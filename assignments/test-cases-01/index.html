  <div class="column big">
    <p>
      The goal of this exercise is to write functions in the editor to the left
      that pass test cases for the functions shown below. Whenever you are ready
      to run the tests, hit the <svg class="bi
      run-code"><use xlink:href="/img/bootstrap-icons.svg#play-btn-fill"/></svg>
      button above the editor. To see the specification for a function you are
      supposed to write, click a button in the test panel. Once you have written
      the function with the right name, the button will indicate whether the
      test cases are all passing (green, with a ✅) or some are failing (red,
      with an ❌) and clicking the button will show the results of the
      individual test cases.
