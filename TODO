- Reincorporate js-games

- Look into setting branch protection rule on main in created repos.

- Add link to branch (or to create PR) from assignment pages. (Could maybe be
  extra fancy and mark the assignment as turned in if the branch has been merged
  to main.)

- Inject run-tests.js into the iframe if testing is on rather than requiring a
  frame to specify it.

- Componentize my editor (i.e. monaco plus the minibuffer, etc.)

- Break out DOM manipulation stuff into module.

- Add README to itp-template

- Move itp-template into gigamonkeys org

- Fix REPL pretty printer

- Give a way to explicitly save with a comment so the branches aren't 100% "Updating".

- Rename gigamonkeys org or make new one.

- Sort out logged out storage situation or rip it out. Goal should be to at
  least allow evaluating new code while logged out. Maybe not necessary to save
  it. (In fact no point in saving it unless we actually then save it all when
  logged in. Which seems maybe too complicated.)

- Finish new-repl and replace REPL with it.

- Show stack traces (see error.stack also
  https://github.com/stacktracejs/stacktrace.js)

- Support multiple files in a project/assignment.

- Move "Saving" indicator into web page.

- Someday, should probably figure out if this thing should really be a GitHub
  App for finer grained permissions plus maybe the ability to do stuff in the
  org that the user doesn't have permission to do.

# Super polish

- Make the clipboard icon in the banner move a bit when you press it.

# Future directions/experiments

- Can we use web workers for evaluation? They can only load from files, it
  seems, which might be a problem. (Maybe just pass the code in as a string via
  postMessage and `eval` or `Function()` it in the worker.)

# Maybe not.

- Investigate using data URLs to import editor code as module into REPL. (Idea
  being: repl code is evaluated as a module but includes a line that does a
  dynamic import of a data URL containing the current code from the editor. That
  would mean that only exported things would be available in the REPL but that
  might actually be good?)

- Use netlify \_rewrite rule
  (https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/) to have a
  single page that handles all branches

- Show SHA subtly somewhere in web page.
