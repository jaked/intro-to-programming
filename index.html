    <p>
      Welcome to Berkeley High’s <i>Intro to Programming</i> class.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website consists of a number of tools you will use to do some of your
      first assignments for this class. We’ll go over getting set up in the
      first day or two of class but the main thing you need to do
      is <a href="https://github.com/signup">sign up for a free GitHub
      account</a> if you don’t already have one. (If you already have a GitHub
      account, it’s probably easiest to use that one for this class but if you’d
      rather create a new account for class that’s fine too.)
    </p>

    <p>
      If you've set up your GitHub account you can look at the tools here. Or if
      you haven't you can still play with them but you won't be able to save
      your work.

      <ul>
        <li><a href="demo/repl/">Play with a REPL</a></li>
        <li><a href="assignments/bouncing-ball">Bouncing ball</a></li>
        <li><a href="assignments/test-cases-01">Testing</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      I also have a tentative <a href="calendar/">class calendar</a>. Obviously
      as this is the first year of this course <i>and</i> my first year teaching
      a full class myself, I expect that I’ll have to make adjustments along the
      way as I see how long different topics actually take. I’m also still
      working on this and probably will be up until the first day of school.
    </p>

<p>
  Finally, same games. Don't expect wildy immersive game play but these will
  give you a quick way to make sure you have certain fundamental bits of
  knowledge solid.
