      Welcome to your first programming exercise. We are going to walk through
      this together in class so don't worry about not yet knowing what to do.
      After this exercise quickly introduces a few topics, we’ll go back and
      actually talk about each of them in more detail.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal is to make an animation of a bouncing ball. Because this is a
      first exercise, I’ve done some of the work for you. Behind the scenes this
      page has already loaded some code that has set up the image you see below
      and has defined several functions and variables that we’ll use to make the
      animation. (What are functions and variables, you ask? Stay tuned and all
      will be explained!)
    </p>

    <div id="container" class="row">
      <div id="left">
        <h2>Put definitions here.</h2>
        <div id="editor"></div>
        <div id="toolbar">
          <span id="minibuffer"></span>
          <svg id="submit" class="bi" fill="#000"><use xlink:href="/img/bootstrap-icons.svg#arrow-clockwise"/></svg>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="right">

        <!-- placeholder for the iframe that will hold the canvas we'll draw on. -->
        <iframe></iframe>

        <h2>REPL just in case you need it.</h2>
        <div id="repl"></div>
        {% include 'codelink' %}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
