# Intro to Programming Tools

A set of tools I'm building for my Intro to Programming class. The idea is to
provide an extremely simple and controllable development environment that
maximally leverages the browser's built in Javascript environment rather than
shipping code to a server.

It also integrates with GitHub to allow my to automatically set up a repo
belonging to each student (once they have a GitHub account) and save their work
into it behind the scenes so I have a record of their code and can use the tools
I'm used to to look at their code. (My current plan is to automatically check in
code on a branch per assignment and then teach them how to use the GitHub
website to create a PR to merge each assignment back to `main` so I can leave
comments on their PRs in the normal way.)

Also included in here is a tool for building a class schedule given a calendar
of school days and an outline of the course. It is unlikely to be useful to
anyone but me without some hacking.
